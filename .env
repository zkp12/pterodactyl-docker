# Pterodactyl Container Variables
#
# DO NOT OVERWRITE WITH PTERODACTYL ".env" CONFIGURATIONS!
# This configuration may look like it has pterodactyl
# variables, and it does, however this config also contains
# variables to initialize/setup the containers. If you are migrating
# or planning to use /data/pterodactyl.conf for all your variables,
# remove anything after "panel variables" stated.

# Panel Variables
# These variables can be used within pterodactyl.conf (.env when symlinked
